Welcome to the repo of Interact. Interact is the standard admin panel for Vesper PHP. And Vesper is a quick custom site builder tool to help you verify minimum viable products.
Yes, you heard that right. A custom PHP framework to build your ideas and test their viability.

## Admin panel

The admin panel is built with Vesper's Sequel, Frontier and some other custom code. It is made so you can add pages yourself via the `App/Controllers` and `App/Models` folders and customise your build. 

## Swappable

If you do not like Interact you can swap this admin panel for another one. One you build yourself for instance. If you do, please let me know.

## Only for Vesper

Interact will probably only work on Vesper but if you want to use it for another tool, be my guest!
